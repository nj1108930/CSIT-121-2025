            <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
            <p>During this project, I learned how to combine various skills from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a complete and functional website. One challenge I faced was creating a consistent layout across all pages and making sure the navigation worked smoothly. It took trial and error, but it helped me understand the importance of planning and page structure.</p>
            <p>I tested my website on Chrome and Firefox, and I also checked it on my phone. I noticed small differences in spacing and layout between the devices, which taught me the value of using media queries and flexible CSS properties to make the site mobile friendly. Overall, this course did more than just teach me code, it got me thinking like a web designer.</p>
