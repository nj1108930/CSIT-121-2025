        <h2>What is WoT Discovery?</h2>
        <p>The WoT discovery is a W3C Web of Things standard and ensures that devices and services can discover one another automatically over the Internet of Things. It allows smart devices to connect and communicate more easily. This standard makes it easier for developers to build systems that connect different kinds of devices, even if they are made by different companies. It uses metadata to help describe devices and what they can do. WoT Discovery can be used in smart homes, smart cities, and other environments where devices need to work together. It provides a way to find and understand devices in a network.</p>
