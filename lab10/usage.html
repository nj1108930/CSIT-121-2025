        <h2>How is WoT Discovery Used?</h2>
        <p>WoT Discovery is used in smart environments like homes, buildings, and factories. For example, a smart thermostat can use WoT Discovery to find a smart light system and work together to save energy. Developers use it in systems where devices need to talk to each other. Instead of manually connecting each one, the devices can automatically find out what others are available and what they can do. An example is a smart city where traffic sensors, lights, and emergency systems use WoT Discovery to share information in real time. This helps improve safety and efficiency.</p>
