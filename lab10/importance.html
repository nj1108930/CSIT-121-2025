        <h2>Why is WoT Discovery Important?</h2>
        <p>WoT Discovery is important because it simplifies how devices are connected and used. Without it, each device might require special setup or separate apps to work correctly. This standard also  brings everything together in a unified way. It helps save time and effort for developers and users by automating how devices are found and understood. This is helpful in places like hospitals, factories, and smart homes where many devices need to work together smoothly. Also, WoT Discovery improves interoperability. That means devices from different brands or with different systems can still communicate if they follow the standard.</p>
