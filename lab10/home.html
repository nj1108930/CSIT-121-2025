        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>I chose the Web of Things (WoT) Discovery standard because I was curious about how smart devices find and connect with each other on the Internet of Things (IoT). I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn about how these systems work together. The site includes four content pages that cover what WoT Discovery is, why it's important, how it's used, and a list of sources I used for research.</p>
