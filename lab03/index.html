            <h3><strong>First Reflection - Lab02</strong></h3>
            <p class="reflection">Creating my first webpage was a challenge. At first, learning about HTML structure and web standards felt overwhelming, but breaking it down into smaller steps helped me understand it better. Now, I feel more confident in structuring HTML documents and following best practices for web development.</p>

            <h3><strong>Second Reflection - Lab03</strong></h3>
            <p class="reflection">Applying CSS to my webpage helped me see how styling makes a huge difference in presentation. I learned how to use classes and IDs to target specific elements, making it easier to control the design. Understanding external stylesheets also showed me how to separate content from design, which improves organization. I faced some challenges with selectors at first, but after experimenting, I was able to fix issues and get my page looking better.</p>
